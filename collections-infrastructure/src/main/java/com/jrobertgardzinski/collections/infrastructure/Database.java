/**
 * Builds the {@link DataSource} and runs the Flyway migrations. With {@code DB_URL} set it is
 * Postgres; without it, an in-memory H2 in PostgreSQL mode — so dev and tests run the SAME JDBC
 * adapter and the SAME migrations the production database runs, with no second schema to drift.
 *
 * <p><b>Every clock this DataSource can block on is EXPLICIT</b>, for exactly the reason the Kafka
 * clocks in {@link PurgeCommandsConsumer} are: the purge runs INSIDE the loop iteration whose gap
 * {@code /alive} measures, so an unbounded database wait is an unbounded liveness gap. pgjdbc
 * defaults {@code socketTimeout} to 0 — infinity — and a database that goes SILENT rather than
 * DOWN (a network partition, a frozen node, a purge DELETE queued behind somebody else's lock; a
 * crashed one is harmless, it answers RST at once) would then wedge the loop thread forever: no
 * beat, {@code /alive} 503, restart, and the new pod walks straight back into the same lock —
 * CrashLoopBackOff over a database problem a restart cannot fix. {@link #WORST_BLOCK} is the
 * bound, and {@link Main#ALIVE_STALL_FLOOR} is derived from it so the two cannot drift apart.
 * Kept deliberately identical to microservice-offboarding's Database: the two services share one
 * saga and one operational story, and a clock that differs between them is a clock nobody can
 * reason about.
